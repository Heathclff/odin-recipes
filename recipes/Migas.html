    <p>"This was my husband's favorite breakfast growing up in a Mexican household," says SHELLSHOCK. "Now we make it all times of day and even our kids always ask for seconds. Very simple, inexpensive, and quick to make. I sometimes add hot pepper sauce, or ingredients you would like in a omelet, but my husband prefers it the traditional way."</p>
